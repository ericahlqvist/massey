# Massey products for imaginary quadratic field with class group of p-rank 2

This program computes Massey products in the Ã©tale cohomology of the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field with class group of p-rank 2. It was written to generate data for [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.06353). 

Some examples on how to explore the data can be found in the notebook: [explore-results.ipynd](explore-results.ipynb). 

This program only works in the specific setup given in the paper. We have decided to keep it like this, not to mix the data with more recent experiments. 

I have a program which is both faster and computes Massey products in much greater generality. Please get in touch if you want access to this.
